# Verified decision procedures for modal logics

The proofs compile after [commit 1780d89](https://github.com/minchaowu/ModalTab/commit/1780d89c4ba14dda9e36ac88b2f1713c90120a0d). For neater proof scripts, please follow the recent commits.

For each implementation, `tableau` or `is_sat` is the function to run. For K, it is in `jump.lean`. For KT and S4, they are in `vanilla.lean`.
